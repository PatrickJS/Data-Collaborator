Data Collaborator
============

Data visualizations unlock insights and initiate important conversations

Our tool, Data Collaborator, enables people to create data visualizations about their Fitbit data, and collaborate with their friends and family, doctors and personal trainers about insights they have about these visualizations

After a user logins in, they can upload a data file, and choose the type of visualization they would like to create

After the visualization is created, you can add collaborators to the visualization and begin discussing your insights

This visualization was made using data from motion sensors that are attached to people’s limbs while they performing various activities

The other visualizations were created using calorie and distance data over a three day period. You can tell when this person was asleep, when they had intense work outs, when they woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom etc…

Vote for data collaborator, and democratize data
