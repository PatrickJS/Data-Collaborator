It uses [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as it's default database, you will need to have it installed and running to get the default app running.\n\nTo get going:\n\n- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:\n    `npm install -g yo`\n- Install the generator **locally**: `npm install generator-express`\n- Ensure that MongoDB is running on your machine, if running elsewhere the connection string can be changed in `config/config.js`\n- Run: `yo express --mvc`\n- Run: `grunt` to run the local server - defaults to `localhost:3000` - port can be changed in `config/config.js`. The grunt tasks include live reloading as before.\n\n##Options\n\n- `--skip-install`\n\n  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after\n  scaffolding has finished.\n\n- `--mvc`\n\n  Installs MVC style scaffolding.\n\n##Testing\nTests are written with mocha.\n- Install: `npm install -g mocha`\n- Run: `mocha`\n\n##Contributing\nContributors are welcome, please fork and send pull requests! If you have any ideas on how to make this project better then please submit an issue.\n\n## License\n[MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)\n",
